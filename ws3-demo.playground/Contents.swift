/* Functions in Swift can be stored in variables and are assigned special function types. In the example below, the variable greet can store any function that accepts a single String variable and does not return a value. To represent a function data type, we list the parameter data types inside parentheses and the return type is written after the arrow symbol. In this example, (String) -> Void. We can assign the function to the variable using the assignment statement. Take note we only provide the name of the function. */

var greet: (String) -> Void = welcome
// We can call the function using the name of the variable.
greet("Paul") // Displays "Welcome Paul"

/* Just like any other variable, greet can be assigned another value with the same data type. We see that welcome and yokoso have the same parameter and return types, therefore they can both be assigned to greet.

/* You can assign closure expressions to a variable instead of a regular function. Closure expressions use the following syntax:

      <function body>
